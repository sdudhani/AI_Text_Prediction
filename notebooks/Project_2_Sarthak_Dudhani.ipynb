In contrary many said that experiences occurred during teenage perod ‡πâhave much more impact to their future. In this essay will disscuss on both point of view and will show some supportive opinions that experiences during the time at school are highly impact futher development in the future for many teenagers.\\nOn one hand, it is the fact that experiences or events happend during their childhood or before they starting to go to school can highly attached to their memories. For example, children would be able to remember the situation where they felt the most insecure or scared, for example, some scary movies or fear of some animals. In which will be further more becomes their wound in their heart. However, these experiences can be erradicated or overcame after in their life and left with just some funny moments for them in the future. Also some of these memories might be erased from their thought since the events appeared during the first recent year of their life could be easily forgettable.\\nOn the other hand, there are higher varieties of experiences occurred during teenage stage of life, in which are more recognizable both from an external factors like their friends, family or their environments in school. And also from their individuals experiences, for example, teenagers are able to realize some of the failure or mistakes that happened in their life such as their examinations failure. In addition to that, some of events might able to happend during the teenages time only, for example, their first love or their first boyfriend/girlfriend. Incorporate all these experiences which can in turn influence their future decision making and their development path in their life.\\nIn conclusion, the experiences occurred as a teenagers are more influence their future life from the fact the varieties of events or situations can take place during this period of time and also some memories that happend during the time before starting school are easily forgettable or overcame.', 'The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.', 'There are a lot of successful people around where you live. Some people can think successful one takes risk and other think they do not take risk. In this case I agree successful people inspire to do new things. \\n\\nTo begin with, they usually try to do new things. They do not want to do the same thing people always do. For example, in growth, people usually go to school when they are young and step to a next stage which is high level school. Then they go to college to get a great education to have a exellent job. But succesful people do not go to school if they do think it is un useful. Thomas Edison is the one who did drop school. \\n\\nIn the same way, after growth, some people just go to work and go home. They would not like to change their life in the better way. But  other are trying to do get another education to get a better job. To give you an example, there are many people to think successful life is having a professional job like being a doctor, lawyer or politican. They try to get in school. That makes them special and successful.\\n\\nIn contrast, there are still many people who give up what they want. Maybe it is difficult to do in their lives because of money, kids and a various kinds of problem. That does not make them unsuccessful.\\n\\nTo sum up, we could see succesful people have risks. But it is true everybody can be successful. In realy, there is still question that successful people is the best noe in our world.']\n",

On the other hand, others argue that experiences from the teenage years have a greater impact on one‚Äôs later life. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present the view that experiences during school years play a crucial role in a teenager‚Äôs future development.\\n\\nOn one side, it‚Äôs true that events from early childhood, even before starting school, can leave a strong impression. For instance, children may vividly recall moments when they felt scared or insecure, such as watching a frightening movie or encountering animals they feared. These experiences can leave emotional marks. However, as people grow older, many of these early memories either fade away or are overcome, sometimes even becoming amusing stories in hindsight. Since these events occur so early in life, they are often easily forgotten as time passes.\\n\\nOn the other side, the teenage years bring a wider range of experiences, many of which are more memorable and influenced by external factors like friends, family, and the school environment. Teenagers also begin to recognize and learn from their own mistakes, such as failing an exam. Additionally, unique experiences like first love or having a first boyfriend or girlfriend typically happen during adolescence. All these events can significantly shape future decisions and personal growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teenage experiences tend to have a greater influence on a person‚Äôs future because of the variety and significance of events that occur during this period. In contrast, childhood memories from before school often fade or are more easily overcome.', 'Walking offers many health benefits, and experts often recommend it as an effective way to stay fit. However, fewer people are walking regularly these days. There are several reasons for this decline, but also a number of ways to encourage more walking. The most common reason people give for not exercising is a lack of time. With busy schedules full of work and family commitments, many feel too tired or rushed to walk and instead choose quicker, more convenient transportation like cars, bikes, or public transit. Safety is another key factor; many people, especially those who work full-time, avoid walking in the early morning or evening if they feel unsafe. Thankfully, there are solutions to these problems. Ensuring pedestrian safety is crucial, so governments should provide adequate sidewalks and street lighting in all neighborhoods, making it safer for people to walk or jog when they have time. Creating dedicated walking paths and parks in communities also gives people a safe place to exercise, especially in the evenings, and encourages a healthier lifestyle overall. In summary, busy lives and safety concerns have made walking less common, but governments can help reverse this trend by improving safety and offering more green spaces for people to enjoy walking.', 'There are many successful people living in your area. Some believe that being successful means taking risks, while others think it‚Äôs about avoiding them. Personally, I believe successful people inspire others to try new things.\\n\\nFirst of all, successful individuals often seek out new experiences. They don‚Äôt just follow the crowd or stick to the usual path. For instance, most people go to school when they‚Äôre young, move on to higher education, and then attend college to secure a good job. However, successful people may choose a different route if they feel school isn‚Äôt beneficial for them. Thomas Edison, for example, left school early.\\n\\nSimilarly, after finishing their education, some people simply go to work and return home each day, without trying to improve their lives. Others, however, pursue further education to land better jobs. Many people believe that a successful life means having a respected career, such as being a doctor, lawyer, or politician. They work hard to get into good schools, which sets them apart.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are still many who give up on their dreams due to challenges like financial issues, family responsibilities, or other problems. This doesn‚Äôt mean they are unsuccessful.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we can see that successful people often take risks. But the truth is, anyone can achieve success. Still, there remains the question of whether successful people are truly the best in our society.']\n"

The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.\n",

However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.\n",

While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.\n",
            "On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.\n",

Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.\n",
